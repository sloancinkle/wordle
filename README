  The project folder "cinkle_final_project" contains code for running two
applications: Shiny Wordle and Shiny Mastermind. The applications can be run
by opening either the "wordle_app.R" or "mastermind_app.R" file in RStudio.

  Once the desired application file is open, it may be necessary to install 
dependency packages before the program can be run. To do this, uncomment the 
first chunk of code in the file (lines 1-3) and run it.

  If all the required packages are already installed, then execute all lines
of code in the application file or click "Run App" to start the program. 

  It should be able to find all of the other files that it needs to access in 
the project folder, but if you need to manually define where the data is, then 
line 23 of the application file can be replaced with: 

setwd("~/cinkle_final_project")

  The final executables of Wordle and Mastermind games can be found at
https://scinkle.shinyapps.io/Shiny_Wordle/ and 
https://scinkle.shinyapps.io/Shiny_Mastermind/, respectively.
